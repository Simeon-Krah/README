# About me
Fascinated about the insights data can give and how it can help in decision making, I'm on a journey to harness its power for growth and solving challenges in healthcare, education and agriculture. Presently, my background in biomedical engineering pushes me further to explore machine learning and large language models for healthcare applications.
